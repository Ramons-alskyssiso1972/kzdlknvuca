So I just got out of Flight Risk, and wow, my brain feels like a jigsaw puzzle missing two pieces — you know, that incomplete but somehow mesmerizing sensation? Ah, the popcorn was old, or maybe that’s just my excuse for the handful I scarfed down during the chase scene. I swear it tasted like stale adventure and a little bit of adrenaline.

The protagonist, oh, what's his name again? Mark? Matt? Anyway, he had this smug charm, like a cat who just knocked your plant over and then pretended it was all to save the world. Mind blown, really. There was this bit where he’s balancing on the side of the plane (what?!), and I just couldn't get over how it reminded me of that time my Aunt Myrtle tried balancing a cake on her head — both equally tense situations but one with more butter icing.

> I was seated next to a walking foghorn, dear lord, what a snorer! The theater echoed with sonic booms louder than any plane in that film. At one point I forgot if I was listening to a jetliner or his nasal symphony. And isn’t it bizarre how these on-screen explosions have the same rhythm as my chiropractor's appointments – noisily realigning my very existence?

When they landed in that random desert (was it a mirage? maybe my imagination’s dessert), I could practically feel the sand getting into my shoes, just like last summer on that accidental beach trip. But instead of sunburns, it was plot twists, fiery and endless.

Oh, I’ve got to remember to download the movie for Josh — he loves anything with a side of chaos and unnecessary jumps from moving vehicles. Yeah, totally watch the movie if loud, crazy airplane antics flying at improbable angles is your kind of turbulence.

Anyway, the divergence there, just like our bus brakes every Thursday — delightful madness. And the score! Astonishing like when doves cry in Prince's dreams. Honestly, if piano keys were strawberries, that soundtrack would be a berry basket.
